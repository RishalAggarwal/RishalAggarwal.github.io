Hi, I'm Rishal a PhD student in the [Joint CMU-Pitt Computational Biology program](https://www.compbio.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. David Koes](https://bits.csb.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh. I work in the interesction of Machine Learning, Structural Biology and Drug Design. My main motivation to pursue this field is to translate machine learning methods to applications with real world impact. I also love the interdisciplinary nature of computational structural biology as it borrows concepts from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and computer science. I have listed below some of the topics on which I am currently developing my projects.

### Topics of interest:

* Virtual screening for drug discovery
* Generative models for molecule design
* Connections between machine learning and statistical mechanics
* Enhanced sampling for molecular dynamics

I graduated with a Bachelor in Pharmacy from Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences (BITS), Pilani and obtained a masters degree in bioinformatics from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH).

In my free time I go climbing, binge shows and play guitar. I'm also a follower of F1 and football.
